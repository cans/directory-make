        dirmake_directories:
          - path: "/home/user/some/path"
            owner: "alice"
            mode: 0600
          - path: "/home/user/some/other/path"
          - path: "/home/user/yet/another/directory"
            group: "bob"
      roles:
         - role: cans.directory-make


    - hosts: servers
      vars_files:
        - vars/part1.yml   # defines directory_list_1
        - vars/part2.yml   # defines directory_list_2
      roles:
        - role: cans.directory-make
          dirmake_directories: "{{ directory_list_1 + directory_list_2 }}"
